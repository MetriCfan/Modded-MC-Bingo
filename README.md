# Modded-MC-Bingo
A modpack for playing Modded Minecraft Bingo using the Bongo bingo mod

This modpack provides a varied and fun Minecraft Bingo experience. The bingo mod being used is Bongo by noeppinoeppi. There are a few fantastic Minecraft bingo mods around but I have found Bongo to be the most configurable and up to date bingo version. Download it at curseforge https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bongo. If you're looking for a more vanilla Minecraft bingo experience this modpack is not for you. There are several options out there for that including the Bongo mod official version at the download link mentioned above.

The modpack uses 69 mods and one structure datapack and is focused on adding lots of structures and items plus world generation customisation that allows a large variation of items in the bingo task pool, and multiple ways of obtaining most of them.There over 600 separate tasks in 33 categories, around 50 of those tasks are tagged tasks meaning that particular task can have more than one option. For example the music disc task will accept any item tagged as a minecraft music disc.

Through the use of datapacks and mod configuration files many vanilla and some of the mods have been configured to ensure an easier ride to getting tasks. There is a separate page on this repository that lists every configured change. There is also an option for operators to spawn a lobby by running a command. This lobby allows easier game setup and team joining. It is suggested to start new worlds regularly and having this option makes that less painful. Once in game there are 2 trigger commands allowing players to return to the lobby or to get an elevated view of the surroundings.
