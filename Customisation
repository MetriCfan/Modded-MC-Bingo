Minecraft:
All shipwrecks are full shipwrecks
Shipwreck treasure chests and Ocean Ruins chests have had the buried treasure map removed as this often causes crashes on servers. The Shipwreck chest has had prismarine crystals added, the Heart of the sea has been moved to small Ocean Ruins chests. One of the custom structures also generates the buried treasure loot.
